## Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science

Just using this doc to keep track of working on as I go.

## Day 1 - Set up/Exploration
OOOOOOOOOOOOkay bunch of new stuff here.

Looks like a lot of the code is in ipynb format, for jupyter notebooks. vscode seems to handle it well, though the course recommends using google colab, a web based env. Dunno about that. I would rather use vscode.

So we have ipynb files and py files. The ipynb is IPythonNotebook, and it's what jupyter notebooks are saved as. This is a format where you can have explanatory text, code and visualisations in one doc. It's kinda nift?

Course recommends using google colab, because it doesn't involve installing/configuring anything, but I think that task is worth practicing anyway.

Ok so you can use the ipynb files for this, or the py files. Even in the py files if you want to have things ... 'cellurised' you can do that by using #%% which indicates the start of a new cell which can then be run individually and inspected in the python interactive window.

Feels like a whole new language tbh :/

I've set up a separate folder for my implementations of things (doing), and this is all I'll commit. 

## Day 2 Finishing data preprocessing section
Implemented the preprocessing functions, comments in pre.py are pretty comprehensive about my understanding of things as I was going.

## Day 3 Linear regression
Let's get this bread.
